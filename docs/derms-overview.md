# DERMS Overview

## Introduction
Distributed Energy Resource Management System (DERMS) is a key component of Schneider Electric's EcoStruxure (ESX) suite, designed to monitor, control, and optimize distributed energy resources (DERs) such as solar PV, wind, battery storage, and electric vehicles. DERMS integrates with ADMS to enable grid operators to manage DERs at scale, ensuring grid stability, energy efficiency, and compliance with regulatory standards.

## Key Features
- **Real-Time Monitoring**: Tracks DER performance, status, and telemetry data from field devices.
- **Forecasting and Optimization**: Uses AI-driven models for energy production forecasting and optimal dispatch.
- **Control and Automation**: Supports automated curtailment, volt/VAR control, and demand response.
- **Integration**: Seamless connectivity with SCADA, ADMS, and third-party systems via protocols like DNP3, Modbus, and IEC 61850.
- **Security**: Implements role-based access, encryption, and cybersecurity best practices for OT environments.

## Use Cases
- Grid modernization: Managing high DER penetration to prevent voltage issues and overloads.
- Virtual power plants (VPPs): Aggregating DERs for market participation and ancillary services.
- Resilience: Enhancing microgrid operations during outages.

## Getting Started
1. Access DERMS via the ESX portal and configure device connectivity.
2. Set up data acquisition from DER assets using the configuration wizard.
3. Review dashboards for initial monitoring and alerts.

For detailed configuration, troubleshooting, or integration guides, refer to specific DERMS articles (to be added).
